I’ve come across a few great online tools that I have used time and time again in creating (and practising) my art and digital sketches. These range from interesting Youtube channels to full fledged art tools that are worth your time to check out.

# 1 – Sycra’s Youtube channel
https://www.youtube.com/user/Sycra
I found this channel  few years ago when I was first getting into digital sketching. It has a whole wealth of information and tutorials ranging from speed-sketching to the fundamentals of anatomy. Definitely worth checking out whether you’re just starting out, or are a full fledged digital art master.

# 2 – JustSketchMe

JustSketchMe is a set of interactive 3D models that a friend of mine and I set up cause we didn’t have a wooden mannequin. You can set the models to different poses for use in figure sketching. I use this both as reference for comic characters, as well as just to practice drawing the human anatomy. There are currently 3 models, male, female and wooden mannequin available, with more on the way.

# 3 – SketchDaily

I was a bit sceptical when a friend of mine mentioned Sketch Daily. It’s one of the better online tools that show a model in a certain pose for a limited time. The idea is to try and flesh out the basic shape as fast as you can, and it works. After the first few attempts to draw the entire person, you realise there just isn’t enough time and finally grasp the age old mantra “build the house before you hang the drapes”.

# 4 – Made with Mischief
https://www.madewithmischief.com/
This is an incredibly cool drawing application. It has an infinite canvas (yes, zoom forever!) and stores all the brush strokes as vectors. This is a great tool to practice digital sketching, and can be an interesting place to brainstorm. There is both a free and paid version. The free version is missing essential features such as layers, but considering the paid app is only $25, it doesn’t bother me too much.

# 5 – Wysp

Wysp is a great place to practice. There are time based exercises (similar to Sketch Daily) ranging from cartoon expressions to dragons. It’s a great place to spend time if you’re interested in improving drastically in a short period of time, but takes some serious dedication. There are a decent amount of free lessons, after which you need to pay to unlock.
